    <string name="htp">The Ghost Word Game is played with two people. In turns, the players
                        must enter a letter that together slowly forms a word. The objective of the
                        game is to add a letter so that no word is formed, but keeping in mind that a word could still be formed.\n\n
                        If your opponent makes a word, when the word contains more than three characters, you win a round!
                        This means that you can not lose if you make a word consisting of 3 characters or less. However, if
                        those characters are not the beginning of a word (like \'zox\'), you still lose a round.\n\n
                        After you won a round, a point is added to your score which can be viewed in the highscores menu.</string>
